**Hard Drive Activity Monitor _for Windows_**

I created this program to be used with Windows 7 and older, because they lack the amazing Task Manager with hard drive monitoring capabilities that Windows 8 and 10 have. I find that accurate and fast to use hard drive monitoring comes in handy every so often when troubleshooting issues.
